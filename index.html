                            <p><strong>Rocket Fiber</strong> is a fiber optic internet, TV
							and business service company. They offer fiber optic services
							to the Detroit area.</p>
							
                            <p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>

                            <p>Rocket Fiber is a new company, so they has no web presence. The goal 
							was to increase awareness, as well as get people who would be interested
							in these services signed up to receive notices and updates when a new
							area is going live.</p>
							
							<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
							
							<p>Rocket Fiber got a fully fluid design, integrated into Wordpress.
							A contact form and newsletter subscription was added to the site.
							Transitions helped convey the modern look and feel of the website.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Life Chest</strong> provides a special
							place to keep your most treasured memories. It replaces 
							your old shoebox of family collectibles with an heirloom 
							quality chest for all your keepsakes.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>

                            <p>The Life Chest needed a home for their products, a place
							where customers could go online, browse through their items
							and place an order. They also needed a place where wholesalers
							could purchase their items in one easy click. On top of this,
							Life Chest wanted to keep everyone up to date with their latest
							happenings, via a blog and a social media stream.</p>
							
							<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
							
							<p>We decided it was best to integrate them into two Content
							Management Solutions, Wordpress, and Magento. With Wordpress
							hauling the load for the blog and content pages, and Magento
							doing the heavy lifting of the shopping cart component, we got
							down to business.</p>
							
							<p>TheLifeChest.com got a new facelift, a fully responsive
							website integrated into Wordpress and Magento. I handled the
							front-end and back-end development, utilizing subtle transitions,
							float labels on their contact forms, and a custom section where
							their wholesalers could buy items at their wholesale price, and
							keep track of everything they've purchased.</p>

                             <p><strong>AM Ginseng </strong> is a ginseng retailer for both
							 retail and wholesale, as well as consumers. The offer 100% pure
							ginseng grown and produced in North America. They are a family owned
							and operated business that use stat of the art facilities to produce
							the best ginseng.</p>
							
                            <p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>

                            <p>AM Ginseng wanted to stand out among the other ginseng retailers.
							They needed a strong web presence that caught the buyers' eyes. They
							offer packaged ginseng that goes through a rigorous routine to ensure
							the best quality. AM Ginseng wanted to tell their story, their process
							and not to only be known for their end product.</p>
							
							<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
							
							<p>AM Ginseng received a super modern and futuristic design. Each detail
							section is slanted, and the electric green really makes you want to stay
							on the page and read more. A nav section that smooth scrolls to the section
							to reveal more information sits atop the various sections to get customers
							the information they're looking for.</p>
							
							<p>A full page navigation with a big lighting bolt slides in from the top
							when the navigation button is clicked. The individual sections, as well as 
							the content pages slide in and become visible as the user scrolls to the section.
							A diagonal background fills the anchor links on hover to round off the subtle techniques
							used to really pull the entire site together.
